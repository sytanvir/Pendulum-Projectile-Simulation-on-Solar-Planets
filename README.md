# Pendulum-Projectile-Simulation-on-Solar-Planets

'SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION & DYNAMICS SIMULATOR APP ' is an APP that can mimic projectile and pendulum motion on any planet in our solar system as well as provide information about that planet. It will also compute crucial variables for the projectile and pendulum system. Information about the planets was retrieved from the NASA Solar System Exploration website.
